Welcome to this repository where I implement the first version of (YOLO)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf]. 
This algorithm is popular and mostly used in real-time object detection systems due to its speed. 
I implemented the paper in Pytorch and (this)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-phGBfPEZ4&list=PLhhyoLH6Ijfw0TpCTVTNk42NN08H6UvNq] series of videos was very helpful.

I trained and tested the model on the PASCAL VOC dataset. You can download the same dataset I used (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/734b7bcb7ef13a045cbdd007a3c19874c2586ed0b02b4afc86126e89d00af8d2].
